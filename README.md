My website's source code. This site is currently online [here](https://voidweaver.dev).

## Building from source

### Prerequisites

1. Make sure you have [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) installed and available in your `$PATH`

### Building steps

When in the project directory,

1. Install dependencies
    ```shell
    $ yarn
    ```
2. Execute the build script
    ```shell
    $ yarn build
    ```
3. The website should now be built into a new `./dist` directory
